        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Muhammad Ali (1942–2016), born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr., was an iconic American boxer, philanthropist, and
            social activist. Known as "The Greatest," he captured the world’s attention with his unmatched skill,
            charismatic personality, and unwavering commitment to justice. A three-time heavyweight champion, Ali’s
            fights, like the “Rumble in the Jungle” and the “Thrilla in Manila,” are legendary. Beyond the ring, he
            became a global symbol of courage, standing against racial inequality, war, and oppression. His legacy
            endures as a champion both inside and outside the boxing ring.
